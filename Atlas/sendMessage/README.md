# sendMessage

The `sendMessage` function is meant to post data on to Cupertino's chatting website.  
This function requires two arguments: channel, and content.  
For an example on how this function works, see [here](https://github.com/Cupertino-Development/docs/tree/master/Atlas/sendMessage/example.js).
