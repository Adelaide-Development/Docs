# Create

The `create` function is meant to post data on to Adelaide's chatting website.  
This function requires three arguments: channel, and content, and token.  
For an example on how this function works, see [here](https://github.com/Adelaide-Development/Docs/tree/master/Atlas/Messages/Create/example.js).
