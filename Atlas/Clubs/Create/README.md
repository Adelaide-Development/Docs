# Create

The `create` function is meant to create a club on Adelaide's chatting website.  
This function requires three arguments: name, description, and token.  
For an example on how this function works, see [here](https://github.com/Adelaide-Development/Docs/tree/master/Atlas/Clubs/Create/example.js).
